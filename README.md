### What you can do in this project?

- View `product list`
- View products by `category`
- View `total orders` in the navbar
- View how many `items` you have in your cart (aplying quantity) in the navbar
- View `total` price in the navbar
- Each product have: `Image, Title, Shipping, Stock & Price`. (and ID)
- You can `add` products by `quantity` to the Cart and `finish the order` (checkout page)
- You can `remove` products from the cart (checkout page)
- You can view a `all` orders list (because in this version we don't have a user system)
